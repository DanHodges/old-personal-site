Six months ago I moved to Nashville to enroll in NSS and start a new career as a software developer. I had spent fifteen years in Jackson, TN. Moving away was difficult, as was putting life on hold, living off savings, and getting used to life in Nashville. 

I’ve always fit been able to connect with a wide array of people. I can speak duck season with rednecks, sports center with sports fans, and Plato with philosophers. Before my transition to NSS, however, computer nerds, seriously intimidated me. I was a code newbie that didn’t play video games, and hadn’t seen all the Star Wars movies.

I imagined I would be quite the black sheep if I followed John Wark’s advice and went ‘networking’ at the local user groups. I was dead wrong. I belong, and I think you belong too. If you’re on the fence hopefully this post will help build your confidence.

Since July, I’ve attended NashJS, PyNash, Code for Nashville, NashFP, Xamarin, ReactJS, and .NET user groups. I went to BarCamp and Music City Code. I volunteered at Nodevember. I’ve had drinks at Greenhouse and played ping pong at Metova. I’m no founding father, but I’ve invested enough time put my two cents in. 

I’d like to mention a few incidents that are indicative of the entire community. I could talk for a long time about all the people who have volunteered their time through code reviews, lunch, and mentorship, but space is limited so I’ll specifically mention just a couple examples.

In my mind, the principal characteristics that define the NashDev community are servant leadership and inclusiveness. I’ve been involved in several social circles (music, religious, academic, etc) and I’ve never seen anything like it.

I met Bryan Hunter at Greenhouse bar after Music City Code. I was two months in at NSS and knew nothing. The guy was incredibly exited about something called Erlang. He was very warm and invited me to his meetup, Nash FP. He seemed to think that if his nine year old could code, I could learn too.

When I finally visited Nash FP, I met a guy named Jason Orendorff. I didn’t know he was a big deal in the programming community. I just knew he was easy to talk to, and we had a great conversation. I didn’t know anything about FP vs OOP, but he didn’t seem to care. I felt confident enough to come back, and to try out other user groups.

A couple weeks later I visited PyNash and had a similar experience. I was standing around awkwardly in the kitchen of the Emma bistro. Jason Myers was cleaning up. He noticed I was trying to meet people. He said to me, “Let me take these pizza boxes out and then I’d like to talk.” That might not sound like a big deal, but anytime someone goes out of the way to make a socially awkward person feel comfortable, it is a big deal.

Becoming a developer is hard. Believing you can be a developer is often harder. When I was at NSS, I struggled with imposter syndrome big time, but a special thing started happening at user groups. I saw these people who were doing incredible things. When we met, they believed I could do incredible things too.

I didn’t believe I was a real developer, but these meetup people certainly did. I started thinking differently. The people at meetups accepted me, so the programming gods must accept me too, right? Maybe I’m not the black sheep here. Maybe these are my people. 

A large part of my initial imposter syndrome was due to my incorrect notions of what makes a good developer. When my instructor Steve Brownlee first told us software development was a team sport, I thought that was a mushy sentiment to make the slow students feel better. No wonder I was so insecure! 

If you think your only value is the sum of your knowledge, you’re screwed. You won’t have the confidence to learn anything, or be a good teammate. Attitude means everything, and there’s a cool thing that happens when you get your attitude straight. Your confidence will grow and your leaning curve will skyrocket. Put the focus on supporting and including others and you will end up a way better developer. "The last will be first, and the first will be last.” I’m not there yet, but participating in the community has helped me come a long way.

The leadership of the NashDev community models excellence, kindness, and inclusiveness. Humans are hardwired to imitate others (Google Rene Girard and mirror neurons). You want to be a rockstar developer? Do what the leaders do- be kind and make someone feel included. It doesn’t matter if you are on the same skill level or use the same language. What matters is that you both believe two brains are better that one and we can use code to make the world a better place. I’d bet you’ll become a way coder developer along the way.
