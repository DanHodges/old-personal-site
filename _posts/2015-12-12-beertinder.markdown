BeerTynder is a hybrid mobile app based off the popular dating app, Tinder. This application allows users to swipe through randomly generated beers from around the world, view detailed information about those beers, and add to personal lists. By tapping the "Social" tab, users can view other users' selected beers and add to their own wishlists.
