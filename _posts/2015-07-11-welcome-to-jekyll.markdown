Soccer Dates is a scheduling app I built for my front-end capstone at Nashville Software School. This app was designed to solve a pain point I experienced as a soccer coach - the dredded scheduling meeting. 
Soccer dates is a client side angular app that uses AngularJS, Google's Material Design, and Firebase for Authentication and REST operations.
